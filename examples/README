Added files for running PanDelos and Roary on three bacterial species obtained from metagenomic sequencing. 

To run the tools:
./prepare_all.sh # modify the script to analyze species of interest

Note that PanDelos and Roary have different requirements you need to fulfill to be able to run these scripts. 
Also, make sure you have run the script ../setup.sh for PanDelos to run.

To run downstream analyses on obtained results:
- process_metagenomes.ipynb
- funcional_analysis_metagenomes.ipynb

These require to put a "diamond" executable in PanDelos-fragments directory

NOTES: 
- for now the analyses are ipynb files for ease of looking at the results, but will be made into python scripts and automated into the test pipeline
- the complete genomes used in the analyses are for now given in the directory, still have to automate their downloads
- still have to upload the tests made on PanProva and scripts used to analyze them!
